# ACL_paper_learning_with_disagreements

## Abstract

We describe SemEval-2023 Task 11, on behav- ioral segregation of annotations to find the sim- ilarities and contextual thinking of a group of annotators. We have utilized a behavioral seg- mentation analysis on the annotators to model them independently and combine the results to yield soft and hard scores.
Our team focused on experimenting hierarchical clustering with various distance metrics for similarity, dissimilarity, and reliability. We then modeled the
clusters and assigned weightage to find the soft and hard scores. Our team was able to find out hidden behavioral patterns among the judgments of annotators after rigorous experiments.

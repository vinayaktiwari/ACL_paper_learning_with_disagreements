# ACL_paper_learning_with_disagreements
We describe SemEval-2023 Task 11, on behav- ioral segregation of annotations to find the sim- ilarities and contextual thinking of a group of annotators. We have utilized a behavioral seg- mentation analysis on the annotators to model them independently and combine the results to yield soft and hard scores.
